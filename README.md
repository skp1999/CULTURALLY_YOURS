# Abstract
Users from diverse cultural backgrounds frequently
face challenges in understanding content
from various online sources written by people
from different cultures. This paper presents
CULTURALLY YOURS (CY), a first-of-its-kind
cultural reading assistant tool designed to identify
culture-specific items (CSIs) for users from
varying cultural contexts. By leveraging principles
of relevance feedback and using culture as
a prior, our tool personalizes to the user’s preferences
based on their interaction with the tool.
CY can use any LLM capable of reasoning
with the user’s cultural background in English based
prompts as the back-end. Using culture
as part of the prompt, CY iteratively refines
the prompt as the user keeps interacting with
the system. In this demo, we use GPT-4o as
the back-end. We also conducted a user study
across 13 users from 8 different geographies.
The results demonstrate CY’s effectiveness in
enhancing user engagement and personalization
alongside comprehension of cross-cultural
content.
