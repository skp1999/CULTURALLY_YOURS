In the Republican Party, former president Donald Trump won his party's support with a massive lead over his rivals. He became the official Republican nominee at a party convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. For the Democrats, Vice-President Kamala Harris joined the race after President Joe Biden dropped out and no other Democrats stood against her. The Democrats are the liberal political party, with an agenda defined largely by its push for civil rights, a broad social safety net and measures to address climate change. The Republicans are the conservative political party in the US. Also known as the GOP, or the Grand Old Party, it has stood for lower taxes, shrinking the size of the government, gun rights and tighter restrictions on immigration and abortion.",
    "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-67949560": "Only two states in US have chosen which Republican they want to take on Democratic President Joe Biden but it's almost certain to be Donald Trump. It's an election campaign being watched not just in the US but around the world. Central American nations are under the spotlight as a growing number of migrants are trying to get to the US through a border which seems more porous by the day. The prospect of Republican Donald Trump returning to office, with his America First foreign policy agenda, adds more uncertainty to an already tumultuous picture. Some countries look forward to his return. But many of America's allies are more fearful about the possible comeback of an unorthodox president they found hard to deal with the first time around. Democratic Senator Chris Coons, who sits on the Foreign Relations Committee and is also co-chair of President Biden's re-election campaign, told that every meeting he's had with foreign leaders or foreign secretaries, at some point they raise the question of whether American voters could really turn once more to President Donald Trump. So, while this may be a US election, other countries are deeply invested in the result.",

As Americans grappled with how to integrate formerly enslaved Black Americans into society, white supremacists in the South called for \"Redemption\" – the removal of rights for Black Americans. But the culture wars as we know it begins in the 1960s, which were rife with movements for liberation and change, according to historians. Marginalized groups in the Civil Rights, Black power, Chicano, feminist and gay rights movements were demanding equal rights and challenging the \"normative American culture\" of the 50s that had begun to solidify. The upheaval of traditional American values was met with anger and backlash – particularly from the Christian and religious right who began feeling like the nation itself no longer represented them or their values. Though other national issues have taken hold of the country's attention – including 9/11 and the 2008 financial crisis, the culture wars have continued to ebb and flow under the surface.",

The event will run from November 22 to 24 at Emirates Palace Mandarin Oriental. On the menu is a medley of cooking demonstrations, masterclasses and a line-up of international and local chefs who will serve their famed dishes for a fraction of their usual Michelin-starred price. Crony, Tokyo (Status: Two Michelin stars): The restaurant’s name refers to \"friends who will drink tea together always\". Also a winner of the Michelin Green Star, the restaurant is big on sustainability. To that end, chef Michihiro Haruta told Michelin he does not use juvenile fish or endangered marine species but does source imperfect vegetables and uses solar salt and honey. Dishes include abalone with summer truffles; cherry salmon with new onion; sourdough bread with butter made from leftover sake-lees; and guinea fowl with spring vegetables. Esquina Comun, Mexico City (Status: One Michelin star): The only way to snag a limited spot in chef Ana Dolores Gonzalez’s rooftop restaurant is via direct messaging on Instagram. The Michelin Guide lauds the restaurant’s “strong techniques and good ingredients”, which shine through in dishes such as salmon in mountain tea adobo; camote gnocchi with rice, bread, ricotta and kumquat; cod green mole with crushed plantain, fava beans and pumpkin seeds; and masa and plantain tamal with red-tinted fish and salsa macha. Row on 45, UAE (Status: Two Michelin star): At Row on 45, nestled high above the bustling streets, you’re treated not only to breathtaking views but to an unforgettable journey into Emirati cuisine, skillfully woven with modern techniques. The experience starts with balaleet, a sweet and savory dish of vermicelli paired with saffron and rosewater, balancing delicate flavors that symbolize traditional Emirati breakfasts. The star of the meal, however, is the perfectly grilled al harees, a creamy, slow-cooked blend of wheat and meat, paying homage to festive gatherings. Each bite is a harmonious nod to age-old traditions yet elevated with contemporary flair.",
    "https://www.dayoutdubai.ae/blog/safari/traditional-food-of-uae/": "We look at the main dishes considered native by the Emiratis themselves. We will cover them individually, from breakfast dishes to dinner and desserts. The Baleetat is a combination of sweet and salty elements. It is a breakfast dish made with an omelet and vermicelli. Sugar, cinnamon, saffron, cardamom, orange blossom, or rose water are added for flavor. Spices are added to the sweetened vermicelli, and the whole preparation is topped with a thin egg omelet. The Chabab bread and Chami cheese (or Kraft cream cheese) are usually served together. Chami is a salty cheese made from buttermilk. Date syrup and honey will top the chebab bread. Sometimes, It is garnished with sesame seeds as well. Serve this breakfast dish hot.The Khameer bread might remind you of the burger bun with a sprinkle of sesame seeds garnished on top. While eating, you can split the layers and fill the butter or cream inside. The bread is so soft that a fresh Khameer will melt with a touch of your tongue. Reqaq is a crispy paper-thin bread made of whole wheat flour. The dough is flattened and cooked in a pan or a hot iron plate. This is almost similar to the Indian flatbread chapati. Machboos is the most popular rice dish in Emirati cuisine. Machboos can be prepared with chicken, lamb, or fish. The main flavorings are cloves, cardamom, cinnamon, lemon, and sometimes saffron. Machboos is, in fact, an Emirati adoption of Indian biryani. Every cuisine in the world has its unique tastes. The signature of the Traditional food of the UAE is the ubiquity of cardamom, thyme, and saffron. They are also heavily reliant on meat and poultry.",
    "https://www.khaleejtimes.com/uae/education/in-love-with-arab-culture-why-abu-dhabi-is-attracting-students-from-the-us": "A university in Abu Dhabi is drawing an increasing number of students from the US, who came to the capital for a multicultural experience and expressed their intentions to return to live and work here. This outcome reflects the Global Education programme at New York University Abu Dhabi that has become an essential component of the campus’ educational mission and curriculum. One of the things Isaiah love most about this campus is the strong sense of community. Isaiah has told many people about it (campus) and even inspired several friends to come to this campus. The community you become a part of here is truly special. Isaiah has fallen in love with the Arab culture. Isaiah is a Christian, but he now loves the culture here, and he learnt a lot about his Muslim brothers and sisters and their faith during his Spring semester when he came here. He also did observe a few fasts during Ramadan for a couple of days. Isaiah, a passionate foodie, highlighted that food for him is an excellent conversation starter and a means of connecting with people from diverse cultures. He says, \"The Machboos was perfectly spiced, with tender chicken and fragrant rice that had a delightful depth of flavor. The balance of spices was spot on, making each bite a unique experience. For dessert, the Luqaimat was a real treat. These golden, crispy dumplings, drizzled with sweet date syrup, were light yet satisfying, and the subtle hint of saffron added an extra layer of richness\". Kuboos with Hummus has become his staple. He actually makes Feta now. Biryani is pretty big here. He really enjoys the Middle Eastern cuisine."
